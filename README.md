# Movie_Recommendation_System
This project implements a movie recommendation system using natural language processing techniques and cosine similarity. Given a movie title, the system recommends similar movies based on their tags, which include movie details like genres, keywords, cast, crew, and release date.

Introduction
This project demonstrates the creation of a movie recommendation system using a dataset of movies. The system takes advantage of natural language processing techniques and cosine similarity to provide movie recommendations based on user input.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes two CSV files: tmdb_5000_movies.csv and tmdb_5000_credits.csv. The former contains movie details, while the latter contains credit information for each movie.

Preprocessing
The dataset goes through several preprocessing steps to extract relevant information and convert it into a usable format. This includes handling missing values, extracting key details like genres, keywords, cast, crew, and release dates, and converting text into a suitable vectorized format for further analysis.

Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using the following command:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the provided Python script to generate movie recommendations:
Copy code
python movie_recommendation.py
Requirements
Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
Setup
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd movie-recommendation
Install the required libraries:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
How it Works
The dataset is preprocessed to extract relevant details from the movies.
Text data is tokenized, stemmed, and converted into a vectorized format using the CountVectorizer.
Cosine similarity is calculated between the vectorized tags of movies.
Given a movie title, the system finds the most similar movies based on cosine similarity scores.
The system recommends the top similar movies to the user.
Results
The recommendation system successfully provides movie suggestions based on user input. The cosine similarity metric helps identify movies with similar tags, leading to relevant and accurate recommendations.

Future Improvements
Incorporate user preferences and ratings to personalize recommendations.
Implement more advanced natural language processing techniques for better feature extraction.
Deploy the recommendation system as a web application for easy user interaction.
